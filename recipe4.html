<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a large pot, heat the ghee or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown.</li>
<li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add the chicken pieces and brown them for about 5 minutes on all sides.</li>
<li>Pour in the chicken broth (or water) and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer.</li>
<li>Add the soaked wheat, turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, and salt. Stir everything together, making sure the wheat is submerged in the liquid.</li>
<li>Cover the pot and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, or until the wheat is soft and the chicken is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent the wheat from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
<li>Once the wheat has broken down and the consistency is thick, remove the chicken pieces from the pot. Shred the chicken and return it to the pot.</li>
<li>Continue to cook for an additional 15-20 minutes until everything is well combined and the mixture reaches a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
<li>Serve the harees hot, garnished with fresh parsley and fried onions if desired.</li>
